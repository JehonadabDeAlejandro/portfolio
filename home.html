    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I like to be optimistic and prove people wrong, when they cant see the bigger picture.I come from a family of 5,
        one little sister and a younger brother. That leaves me as the oldest. I consider myself a family man, for I do
        care for them a lot." A who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man", -Don Corleone.
        Great words in my point of view. Never the lease my past is a story in itself, that I look back as a stepping
        stones taking me to a better future. I haven't had much experience with coding, but it has always caught my
        interest.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
        In world of computer development there are some many applications that you can learn. It is something that as a
        developer, we have to keep up with the up and coming or else that train will leave you behind. If you don't like
        change, at times you may become restricted or outdated. A few things that I would like to learn,
        to say the least are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>To be more confident with HTML.</li>
        <li>As well as CSS, for HTML and CSS go hand in hand.</li>
        <li>Being able to learn the concept of Javascript.</li>
        <li>Learning how to find solutions to problems when one is working on their coding.</li>
        <li>Having the ability to create something from scratch, that at one point I didn't think it would be
            possible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        One of my job experience, was being a <i>Quality Assurance and Calibration Tech.</i> I started working with the
        company in 2009 and I decided to terminate my employment in September 2015. All my jobs have always been hands,
        and a somewhat of computer work. But for the most part hands on. I worked on various medical projects as well as
        military projects. I cannot really say much about the work that I did there, for i have signed a contract. Never
        the less some of things i can say is, that I had to trouble shoot machines that brake down and recalibrate them.
        To make sure everything was in order. The testing that I would also do, would be on uncured and cured silicone,
        adhesive material, silica to name a few. More over I would work side with auditors and they would give us
        surprise visits. Answering question and assisting them on various task.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other job experience i am going to talk about, is working at a advance checking location. My job duties
        consist of customer care, cashier, application loan officer, care calls, over the phone meetings with
        corporate and depositing money from our store to the bank. Just a few to name. I did enjoy my job there, but I
        had hands tied behind my back when it came to certain situations. That i could discuss at a later time. Why you
        say then I enjoyed my job there for the time of my employment.It was some of the interaction a had with
        customers. It was as if we where family at one point. They would be happy to see and just talk about what
        they had going on, others would come in on Saturday just so that they could have a longer conversation with.But,
        I had to move on to other opportunities.
